# Fitness Ecommerce Store

Fitness is an important way of staying healthy. Here I create a
ecommerce store for my client with form validation, authentication,
pagination, all while storing information in a postgres database. This 
site is deployed with heroku for my personal portfolio, and will deploy
on a ubuntu server via digital ocean using nginx for development.
